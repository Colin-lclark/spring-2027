# Project: ER Diagram

This is a team project. Work on it with your assigned team. Only one of you
needs to turn it in — but make sure someone does!

## Objective

* Draw an ER Diagram and create a glossary for a database to be built around
  the [City of Portland Tree
  Inventory](https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c2b02440053f459db71e1109b9947e51_1415/explore)
  dataset

## Details

Database design begins with verbal or written requirements for the database.
Requirements are formalized as an entity-relationship model. First, your group
should discuss these requirements. What kind of questions should this database
help you answer?

The only constraints for this database is that it must contain at least one
one-to-many (or many-to-one) relationship and at least one many-to-many
relationship. To fulfill these constraints you may need to involve another
data source in addition to the City of Portland Tree Inventory dataset.

In this assignment, you must develop an ER diagram representing your data
organization along with the necessary glossary.

The diagram must include:

* Entities
* Attributes, their names, and their cardinalities
* Relationships, their names, and their cardinalities
* [Title
  block](https://machinistguides.com/blueprint-reading-guide/#Components_of_a_drawing)
  include the names of all participants in your group (if one person didn't
  contribute, don't include their name), along with the database name, the
  diagram version (most likely `1.0`), and when the drawing was completed.


Use the glossary to describe aspects of your data organization that may not be
apparent in the diagram. For instance, the glossary may provide additional
information about a particular attribute such as the convention used to store a
spatial coordinate or constraints in the naming of a species.


## Tool

Use [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) for drawing the diagram. Use a text
or document editor for your glossary.

## What to turn in

Hand in a PDF of your drawing and your glossary (two separate files).
