## Database goals

Recall that one of the requirements of a database is efficiency: temporal and
spatial.

Mechanisms used to achieve this efficiency include:

* Unique, stable, simple, meaningless primary keys

  Quickly find the needed information (temporal).

* Indices

  Quickly find the needed information (temporal).

* Normalization

  Eliminate redundancy to reduce storage overhead (spatial) and maximize speed
  in certain updates (temporal).

The goal is to be efficient while at the same time meet the other requirements
of a database (authorization, security, rules, and recovery).
