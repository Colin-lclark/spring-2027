# Note 01

I've been asked to maintain information about course scheduling and attendance
at an hypothetical school. This
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/139pyFacFn594tCqxuORAvUFx3I7kBRao4Ev42rmxtDI)
is the initial result of my work.

You've been hired to check my work.

Some questions:

* Is there is any information missing?

* Can you envision the kinds of the operations one is likely to want to do on
  on this data? Provide a list.

* How many rows of data needs to be inspected, if one needs to change the name
  of a student?

* How many rows of data needs to be altered, if one needs to change the name
  of a student?

* What do you think might be meant by the *consistency* of this data?

* Given the current structure of the information, how easy is it check its
  consistency?
