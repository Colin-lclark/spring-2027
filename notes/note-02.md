## Entity-relationship model

> An entity–relationship model (or ER model) describes interrelated things of
interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of
entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships
that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types).

> In software engineering, an ER model is commonly formed to represent things a
business needs to remember in order to perform business processes. Consequently,
the ER model becomes an abstract data model, that defines a data or information
structure that can be implemented in a database, typically a relational
database.

### ER diagram

Entities, relationships, and attributes are depicted in an entity-relationship
diagram, commonly called an ER diagram. 

We will use [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) to draw our ER diagrams.
